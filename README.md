# How-To-Make-An-Auto-Completion-Program-In-Python
Create An Auto-Completion Program Written Entirely In python.

**Lately, Iâ€™ve been into writing an epic fantasy novel to take a break from programming. I found a good editor program with good features. But after some time I found problems with the program. I found it hard to write because the program had no autocompletion. Being a user of sublime editor the problem was worse as it had an autocompletion when coding.<br/>**
That triggered an idea for a new project in python. I knew that my Smart edit(The program I used for writing) was really good except for this little problem. So I decided to make my code work as an extension for it. I wanted It to work for every other text editor program like notepad,notepad++, etc.

Before starting you have to install some libraries :
```python
pip install keyboard
# For More Info :https://pypi.org/project/keyboard/
pip install numpy
# For More Info :https://numpy.org/doc/
pip install pandas
# For More Info :https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/
pip install win10toast
# For More Info :https://pypi.org/project/win10toast/
```

## We will use:<br/>
***Keyboard to Get Inputs from the keyboard.<br/>
Numpy to make an array .<br/>
Pandas to get key abbrevations dataset .<br/>
Win 10 toast to make toasts in the screen.***<br/>
